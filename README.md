## Installation

### Option 1: Official GNOME Extensions (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Gnome Clipboard is through the official GNOME Extensions portal.

1. Install the **Extension Manager** app from Flathub or your distribution's package manager.
2. Search for "Gnome Clipboard" within the app and click install.
3. Alternatively, install directly from the web: 👉 **[Gnome Clipboard on GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4422/gnome-clipboard/)**

### Option 2: From Source Code (For testing & latest features)

If you want the absolute latest version, you can build and install the extension using our professional build system.

**Prerequisites:**
- `git`, `make`, `nodejs` & `npm` (uses `npx` for the TypeScript compiler)

**Build Commands:**

1. **Clone and Build (Zip only):**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   *Compiles the source and packs the extension into a `.zip` file for manual distribution.*

2. **Build and Install:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   *Compiles, packs, and installs the extension to your local GNOME environment.*

3. **Enable and Listen:**
   ```bash
   make enable
   make listen
   ```

4. **Restart GNOME Shell:**
   For the extension to be recognized, you must restart the GNOME Shell.
   - **X11**: Press `Alt` + `F2`, type `r`, and press `Enter`.
   - **Wayland**: You must log out and log back in.

   Alternatively, you can run our automated script which detects your session type:
   ```bash
   make restart-shell
   ```

**For Developers:**
If you are actively developing and want to automate the build-install-restart loop, simply run:
```bash
make test
```
*(Warning: If you are on Wayland, running `make test` will automatically log you out to apply the changes!)*

You can monitor logs using:
```bash
make listen
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

The project uses a standard `Makefile` to manage the build lifecycle:

- `make build`: Default target. Compiles and packs the extension into a ZIP.
- `make install`: Compiles, packs, and installs to the system extensions directory.
- `make clean`: Removes the `dist` build directory and ZIP artifacts.
- `make update-translations`: Extracts new strings and updates all `.po` files.
- `make test`: Full cycle: Install, Enable, and attempt to Refresh the Shell.

## 🌍 Contributing & Translations

Contributions are extremely welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue.

### Adding a new translation
1. Run `make update-translations` to refresh the template.
2. Create or edit the `.po` file in the `po/` directory using Poedit or `msginit`.
